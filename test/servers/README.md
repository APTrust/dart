# SFTP Test Server

The files in this directory are used to test DART's SFTP client.

* sftp.js implements a minimal SFTP server
* sftp-private-key.pem is the server's private key. There's no danger in exposing this on a public repo, because the key isn't used anywhere else.
* sftp-public-key.pem is the private key's corresponding public key.
