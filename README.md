# DART

In 2018, APTrust opened its services to depositors at smaller institutions
that did not have the technical resources to package and upload digital
materials into a remote repository.

APTrust created DART, the Digital Archivist's Resource Tool, to provide a
simple drag-and-drop application for non-technical users to package and
upload materials to a remote digital repository.

DART currently supports the BagIt packaging format, but may include additional
packaging formats in future.

DART 2 is the current, stable version of DART. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

We have a DART 3 beta available, but it's not yet steady enough for production
use. If you're starting with DART, start with DART 2.

# DART User Group

APTrust hosts a [DART User Group](https://aptrust.org/resources/user-groups/dart-user-group/) for the entire digital preservation community. This group will primarily be a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/aptrust.org/g/dart-users), where users can share experiences, ask questions, and support one another. Depending on the level of interest and engagement, we may expand this initiative to include regular virtual meetings and more structured activities in the future.
