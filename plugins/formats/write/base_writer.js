  * serialized formats that must be written one at time, in order (such
  * as tar format).

  *
  * @param {function} writeFn - The function that writes each file into
  * the archive, directory, or serialized format you are creating. This
  * function should take two params, (data, done), where data is any
  * JavaScript object and done is a callback to be called when the file
  * has finished being written.
  *
  * See {@link TarWriter} or {@link FileSystemWriter} for examples of
  * the writeFn and how subclasses can be implement.
