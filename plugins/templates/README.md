# Plugin Templates

This folder contains templates to help developers write their own DART plugins.

## Network Client Templates

Use the [network_client.js](network_client.js) template as a starter for writing a network client. Also see the built-in [S3](s3_client.js) and [SFTP](sftp_client.js) clients for examples of how to handle status events and retries.

Also take a look at the tests to see how to verify your clients are working.
