# This is the user.conf file for our test SFTP server, which runs in a
# Docker container. The container mounts this file with the following
# command line setting (see scripts/test.rb):
#
# -v <this_dir>/users.conf:/etc/sftp/users.conf:ro 
#
# Note that the SFTP container is quite finicky about users.conf. Be sure
# each entry in this file includes an explicit home director and ends with
# /bin/bash, or you'll get 'permission denied' errors for everything.
#
# Also note that while pw_user has a password, key_user does not. This is
# because we want to force key_user to log in with the SSH private key at
# testdata/sftp/sftp_user_key so our tests can ensure private key auth
# works as intended.
pw_user:password:1001::/home/pw_user:/bin/bash
key_user::1002::/home/key_user:/bin/bash
